# Securing .Net 5 Microservices With IdentityServer4

We will learn how to secure microservices using standalone Identity Server 4 and backing with Ocelot API Gateway. Weâ€™re going to protect our ASP.NET Web MVC and API applications using OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect in IdentityServer4. Securing our web application and API with tokens, working with claims, authentication and authorization middlewares and applying policies. We will secure our ASP.NET based microservices applications with IdentityServer4 using OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect on a distributed microservices architecture.
